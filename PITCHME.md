- Each page loads very fast

- Album artwork is consistent in size
- Pages for adding models are very clean and pleasant to look at
- Search results have nice looking tabs to filter results by model
- UI elements that are easy to click or browse through

<span style="color: #e49436">What did we learn from their website?</span>


- A page can load fast, but still feel a little slow if its content takes a while to load in images.
- Header/label size and color can make a world of difference in making important elements more visible and distinct. <img src="http://i.imgur.com/DLL3Wzf.png" alt="Logo" style="width: 175px;"/>
- Having many options for filtering makes finding content much more convenient.

<span style="color: #e49436">What can they do better?</span>

- Model images could load faster.
- Smoother transitions when browsing through models.
- Model instance pages could be formatted better (particularly those that include songs).

- More consistency in UI element design.
- Models other than albums are not consistent in size.
