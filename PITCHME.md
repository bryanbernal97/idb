<span style="color: #e49436">What did we learn from their website?</span>


- A page can load fast, but still feel a little slow if its content takes a while to load in images.
- Header/label size and color matter a lot in UI design.

- Having many options for filtering makes finding content much more convenient.

<span style="color: #e49436">What can they do better?</span>

- Model images could load faster.
- Smoother transitions when browsing through models.
- Model instance pages could be formatted better

- More consistency in UI element design.
- Models other than albums are not consistent in size.
