PlanITpoker Phase 2
Group 2
05 July, 2017

1. Populate database
        Estimated time: 5 hours
        Actual time: 18 hours
        
        Arguably one of the more difficult aspects of this phase for us; spent a long time debugging
        the code and changing other files to fix errors.

2. Create carousel to scroll through the queried list of Users, Games, Communities, and Teams
        Estimated time: 5 hours 
        Actual time: 4 hours

3. Implement Pagination
        Estimated time: 5 hours
        Actual time: 10 hours
        
4. Implement filtering and sorting
        Estimated time: 2 hours
        Actual time: 13 hours
        
        Both numbers 3 and 4 kind of went hand-in-hand. It seemed straight-forward enough once
        we had the populated database, but making it work with the front-end was more challenging
        than expected.
        
5. Integrate React with our current code
        Estimated time: 10 hours
        Actual time: 15 hours

        Estimated time: 1 hour
        Actual time: 1 hour
        
7. Create main models using SQLAlchemy
        Estimated time: 3 hours
        Actual time: 5 hours
        
8.  Update Technical Report with the process of getting a database and the use of new tools.
        Estimated time: 2 hours
        Actual time: 2 hours
        
9.  Implement Restful API
        Estimated time: 4 hours
