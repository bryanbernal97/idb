1.  Add recaptcha to edit button
        Estimated time: 3 hours
        Actual time:  3 hours

2.  Locate database update error
        Estimated time: 30 minutes 
        Actual time: 6 hours

        We ran into an interesting time where the correct data was being printed to the console, but not stored into the database at the correct timing. Ended up being a RHS vs LHS issue.

3.  Create editable forms for each model
        Estimated time: 4 hours
        Actual time: 6 hours

        Just took longer than expected--no real trouble here.
        
4.   Connect edited info to all connected models/attributes
        Estimated time: 2 hours
        Actual time: 6.5 hours

        Seemed like an easy enough solution, however it proved to take a lot more effort than we thought to do this without slowing the site way down.
        
5.  Create searchable games drop down for editing
        Estimated time: 1 hour
        Actual time: 1 hour
        
6.   Implement Recaptcha
        Estimated time: 2 hours
        Actual time: 4 hours
        
        We changed the type of recapcha we were implementing a few times, and had trouble updating the image on different pages.
        
7.   Add unit tests for last phase
        Estimated time: 2 hours
        Actual time: 1 hour

        Actual time: 1 hour
