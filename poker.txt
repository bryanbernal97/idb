PlanITpoker Phase I
Group 2
19 June, 2017

As a caveat, we had a difficult time writing user stories for this phase. 
Because of the static and incomplete nature of the site, a lot of our stories
were implemented quickly through the data we scraped from the Twitch API. For example,
if a user wanted to find out the communities a particular streamer was a part of, due to
the thorough and robust interface Twitch provides, it was relatively simple to add it to
the site. 

While we can individually describe each story and how long it took to complete them, for
the sake of not repeating the same reasons over and over again, I will group several stories
together and write out the assumptions and estimates for the entirety of them.


User Stories
==============================================

1.As a user, I want to see which streamers are involved in a community.

    Estimates: 1/2, 1/2, 0, 1/2
    Consensus: 1/2 or 30 mintutes
    Actual: 3/4 when considering it part of the total time taken

    We wanted to start with this one because, as shown above, one person had a different idea of
    how long it would take to implement. They figured because it's just scraped data, it would
    probably only take a few seconds to get it up on the actual website. The rest of us discussed
    it and said our reasoning was that, along with the other information we want available to our site,
    the time it'll take to learn how to scrape data, use Twitch's API, and get it correctly formatted 
    would probably take a handful of hours. Therefore, on this one particular story, most of us split up
    the total time it would take and deemed this one "1/2".

    So for the rest of this list, which includes:

    2. As a user, I want to see all the members of a particular team.
    3. As a user, I want to look at a game's page and see all the streamers who have played it.
    4. As a user, I want to find a list of communities so I can join the ones that fit my interests.
    5. A user can see what games a particular streamer has played before.
    6. A user can see how popular a certain community is through view counts and subscriptions.
    7. A user can see how popular a streamer is by their views and subscriptions.
    8. A user can view whether or not a streamer has the mature flag up.

    we all estimated 1/2 for each story. Total time was more like 3/4-ish for each, but there wasnt a card
    for that value. The entirety of the time was perhaps 7 hours.

9. As a developer, I want to have a static mock-up of the website so I can begin planning
necessary implementation.

    After some thought, this story might have been too "high-level", but regardless the estimates
    were all over the place. 
    
    Estimates: 2, 10, 13, 20
    Consensus: 20 (20 hours plus or minus some)
    Actual: ~20
    
    One of our members actually had some experience in web development and told us 20 hours seemed
    fair. It allows some leeway to get some of us unexperienced folk up to speed when learning what
    exactly we needed to do and how to do it. In the end, it took perhaps a little less than the 20
    estimated hours, but that was much better than assuming it would have taken 10 and doubling that.
    
10. User can see the bios and contact information for the developers of the webstie so they can hire
them for a lot of money.

    Estimates: 1/2, 1, 1, 1
    Consensus: 1
    Actual: ~1
    
    Time spent waiting is still time spent, so we all kind of gave the estimate of an hour so everyone
    can come up with a fitting and short bio while deciding on a proper photo. Actually adding it to
    the site didn't take long.
    
    We also decided on this as a legitimate use case because Professor Downing seems particular about us
    learning skills useful for actual jobs, so having our bios on the site can be a good way to show off our
    work.
